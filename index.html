            Akan Naming System
        </h1>
        <div class="intro">
            <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. 
             Frequently in Ghana, children are given their
              first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.
            Here is a Ghanian naming system that produces the corresponding akan names for both gender.</p>
